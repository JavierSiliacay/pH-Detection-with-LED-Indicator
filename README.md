# pH-Detection-with-LED-Indicator
This project uses an Arduino and a pH sensor to monitor pH levels and visually indicate the pH range using LEDs. Red LED indicates unsafe levels, Blue LED for slightly acidic, Yellow LED for slightly basic, and Green LED for safe conditions. It also prints pH values to the serial monitor for monitoring and debugging.
