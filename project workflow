1. Initialization:

Set up the pH sensor and LEDs with the respective pins on the Arduino.

Initialize the serial communication to display pH values on the serial monitor.

Set all LEDs to LOW initially (off state).

2. Sensor Reading:

Continuously read the analog value from the pH sensor.

Convert the analog value to a corresponding voltage.

Use the voltage to calculate the pH value based on a predefined formula.

3. pH Level Evaluation:

Based on the calculated pH value, determine the pH condition:

If the pH is below 5.0 or above 9.0, the solution is unsafe.

If the pH is between 5.0 and 7.0, the solution is slightly acidic.

If the pH is between 7.0 and 7.9, the solution is safe.

If the pH is between 8.0 and 9.0, the solution is slightly basic.

4. LED Control:

Reset all LEDs to LOW.

Light up the appropriate LED based on the pH value:

Red LED for unsafe pH.

Blue LED for slightly acidic pH.

Green LED for safe pH.

Yellow LED for slightly basic pH.

5. Displaying pH Value:

Print the analog value, voltage, and calculated pH value to the serial monitor for real-time monitoring.

6. Continuous Operation:

Repeat the process every 500 milliseconds (delay) to continuously monitor and update the pH value.
